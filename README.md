# Gigachess

Our modifications and additions of the game of Chess, following the same concepts and rules of Chess, but with new pieces, movements, and a bigger board.

## New Stuff
- A bigger board (from 8x8 to 10x10)
- New Pieces
  - Bomber
    - Moves like a pawn with diagonal additions.
    - If the bomber is killed (excepting the Assassin) it will destroy all pieces in a 1-Tile "+" radius.
  - Royal Guard
    - Can move anywhere in a 1-Tile radius, like a king.
    - It is invincible but killable from behind or by the hands of the Assassin.
  - Assassin
    - Can eliminate the bomber and Royal Guard without activating their abilities.
    - Moves in a diagonal square pattern.
    - Assassins can hop over other pieces like a knight
  - Archer
    - Has the choice to either shoot or move on a given turn.
    - Movement is the same as a king, attacks are diagonal tiles.
    - Attacks do not move the archer
- New starting positions to accomodate bigger board and more pieces
